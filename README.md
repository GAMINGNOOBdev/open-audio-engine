Open Audio Engine
=================

A simple audio engine designed in C to use for streaming audio.
Designed to work on both the psp and PC platforms.

# Using the examples/vscode launch option

To use the provided launch option and the psp tests, create a `snd` folder and add 2 files called `0.ogg` and `1.mp3` to test the music and sfx.
`0.ogg` is the music file, while `1.mp3` is a sound effect.

# How to embed
Take a look at [test.c](https://github.com/GAMINGNOOBdev/open-audio-engine/blob/main/test/test.c).
Usage should be pretty simple! :p
